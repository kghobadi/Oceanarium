i have brought you the the world of coral. 
here you you will find multiple shrines.
there are four in total.
just as there are four planets orbiting this one.
each shrine can be activated at any time.
the pearls should be near, within each cluster of coral.
except for the one behind us... 
that shrine leads to a dead place
where our great forefather slumbers
yes, the spirit whale itself
you can travel to the others in any order.
ultimately, we must come back here. 
if you follow me, i can show you the path.
